    "This is a *pass or fail* course. Your grade will be determined based on your participation in the tutorial sessions. Each week, you are expected to work on a number of exercises, which you can find on the schedule here or on Canvas. At the end of each session, you should hand in your exercises via Canvas. Only when you've handed in all your exercises can you pass this part of the course. If you don't hand in the exercises, or it is clear from the answers that you haven't seriously considered working on the problem, you will fail the course."
