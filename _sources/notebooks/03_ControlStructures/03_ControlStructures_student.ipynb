So far, your scripts have been quite predictable. They are a series of statements that are executed from top to bottom, i.e., sequential execution. One nice feature of almost all programming languages is that they allow the use of *control structures* that direct the execution of your program. One of the most commonly used control structures is the conditional statement `if`. An `if` statement looks like this:\n", "\n", "```python\n", "if <expr>:\n", "    <statement>\n", "```\n", "\n", "Here, `<expr>` is a *boolean* expression, i.e., something that takes on the value `True` or `False`. The `<statement>` is a valid Python statement, something that will be executed if `<expr>` evaluates to `True`. The colon `:` is part of the Python syntax and should always be placed after the boolean expression. Further, note that there is some whitespace in front of the `<statement>`. This is called *indentation* and is also part of the Python syntax. Python uses four spaces as indentation. You usually don't have to care of this yourself: the interpreter and any IDE that knows that you're programming in Python will help you automatically use that indentation when necessary. \n", "\n", "To get a better feeling about the behavior of the `if`-statement, take a good look at the following code examples.
