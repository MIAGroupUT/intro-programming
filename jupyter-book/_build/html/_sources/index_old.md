# Jupyter book template

## Sections

The Jupyter Book is divided into the following sections:

- Introduction

  - [README](introduction)

- Tutorial0

  - [Student version](notebooks/Tutorial0_Template/Tutorial0_Template_student)

  - [Teacher version](notebooks/Tutorial0_Template/Tutorial0_Template_teacher)


## Execution of the notebooks

Each of the next sections can be downloaded as a notebook (a mix of text and
code) that can be executed locally on your computer or run in a cloud instance
(useful if you do not have a GPU available in your computer).  For the later
case, when available, links to instances of Google Colab and UT Jupyterlab are displayed.

### Run in the Cloud

Interactive notebooks can be launched using a **Google Colab** instance. To do
this, click on the icon <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>
 in the upper right side of the corresponding page. When
launching the **Colab**, an initial step is proposed to set-up the notebook
with the necessary software, this can take some time, particularly for the
notebook "Prepare your neuroimaging data". Notebooks can be run independently.

### Local execution of the notebooks

Use Conda/miniconda to setup your local environment and to execute these
notebooks. If the tool is not installed in your system, please follow [these
instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install it.


## Troubleshooting

- If you are not able to exploit your GPU card, please reinstall Pytorch by
  following instructions available in their
  [webpage](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
