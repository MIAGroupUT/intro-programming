By programming in Python you can tell the computer how to do things. Just like Python, there are many other programming languages out there. You might have heard about some of them, like `C`, `C++`, `Java`. Alternatively, it might be that you have heard of (or used) `Matlab`. In general, programming languages have a lot of similarities. They all allow you to work with data such as information provided by the user or stored in a file, and do something based on that input. They (almost) all have ways to visualize results. Of course, there are also differences. Languages differ in the way that your code is *executed* on the computer, in the *syntax* that you should use when writing code, in naming conventions, etc. We use Python here because it is a widely used language that is user-friendly and allows you to get a grasp of fundamental concepts in programming. \n", "\n", ":::{admonition} Python\n", ":class: note\n", "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.\n", "::: \n", "\n", "Python is a high-level language, which means that it is easy for humans to read and write Python.

Some are very expensive and intended for professional use, some are free. Some are complex, some are easier to use.
