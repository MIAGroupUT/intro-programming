The most common way to work with such objects in Python is using the NumPy package. NumPy is the workhorse for anything related to vectors and matrices and offers functions beyond your wildest dreams. Moreover, many other packages in Python are able to use NumPy arrays. Among these the one-dimensional arrays (aka vectors) and two-dimensional arrays (aka matrices) and numbers are the most common.\n", "\n", "## Importing NumPy\n", "NumPy is a Python package that needs to be imported in order for you to use it. To import NumPy, just write ```import numpy as np``` at the top of your script. Note that here we are importing the NumPy library with an alias `np`. \n", "\n", "## Arrays\n", "Numpy uses objects called *arrays* to store 1D, 2D, 3D, nD data. It's important to realize that it doesn't matter if you have a 1D vector, a 2D matrix, or a 3D or 4D tensor: it's all stored as an array. \n", "\n", ":::{admonition} Numpy matrices\n", ":class: warning\n", "In the NumPy documentation you might also find something about *matrices*.

Slicing in a NumPy array is very similar as in a list\n", "\n", "## Vectors\n", "Vectors are easily defined by listing the entries separated by commas or spaces, e.g., ```v = [11, 12, 13]```. The number of entries of a vector is known as the *length* of the vector. Each array also has a shape, which in the case of a vector, has only one value (which is the same as the length). Each value in an array is called an *element*. You can always find out the shape of your vector by asking for its `shape` attribute."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "cbc5dcd4", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np\n", "\n", "v = np.array([-1, np.sin(3), 7])\n", "print(v)\n", "print(len(v))\n", "print(v.shape)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "78692dc7", "metadata": {}, "source": ["A vector can be multiplied with a scalar (a number) and added to or subtracted from another vector.
