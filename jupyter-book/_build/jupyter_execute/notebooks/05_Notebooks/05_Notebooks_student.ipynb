Now we're going to teach you a *third* and very popular way to program in Python: using notebooks. A **Jupyter notebook** is a file that can contain code and text. In fact, you're looking at a notebook right now! A notebook consists of *cells* and each cell can be *run* by a Python *kernel*. This Python kernel is like a Python interpreter that is continuously running in the background and keeping track of your variables."

The only difference is that a notebook file should always end in an `.ipynb` extension. If all is well, when you create a file (for example `my_notebook.ipynb`) and open it in VS Code, you should get the notebook editor view. This view is a bit different from the normal Python script editing view. The file already contains one *cell* that you can start editing. However, before you start editing, it's good to select a Python kernel. For this, click on `Select Kernel` in the top right of the screen. This takes you to your list of Python Environments, where you should again select your Anaconda Python interpreter.\n",

Markdown cells can be used to write comments, explanations, other documentation in between your blocks of code, or you can use them to add headers to your blocks of code. Markdown is a *markup language* like HTML that provides options to write text **bold**, *italic*, use $\\LaTeX$, add headers, etc. We are not going to teach you all markdown commands here, but you can find an overview of the most commonly used Markdown statements [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Markdown can be very useful when building documents. In fact, this entire manual is written in Markdown. You can download each chapter as an `*.ipynb` file and run it as a notebook."

The Jupyter kernel will then execute the contents of the cell, and if there is any output, that output will be shown directly below the cell. This is similar to how you've used scripts before, with two main differences:\n",
    "1. The output is directly shown in the notebook, and not in a terminal window.\n",

Not of all of them are equally useful, but you can get a full list by typing `%quickref` in a cell and running that cell. Some example of useful commands are `%who`, `%%time` and `%timeit`. Just like the variable inspector, `%who` shows you the variables in the current session.

    "## Alternative ways to run notebooks\n",
    "The notebook format in `.ipynb` is not restricted to VS Code. In addition to running a notebook directly in VS Code, you can run notebooks in (at least) threeother ways: on a Jupyter lab server, on the UT JupyterHub, on Google Colab.\n",

    "1. **Running a Jupyter lab server**\n",
    "In a terminal window (for example Anaconda Prompt), navigate to the directory in which you want to work and type `jupyter lab`. This should start a Jupyter lab environment in your browser. If this does not happen, look at the output in your terminal and find the address of the lab environment. This is usually something like `https://localhost:8888`. It might be that you need a token (kind of password) to login to your Jupyter lab environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The UT Jupyter server**\n",
    "The University of Twente has an own JupyterHub server. This is a Jupyter environment on which many students/employees can log in at the same time (without accessing each others scripts and data). To use this server, go to [the UT Jupyter website](http://jupyter.utwente.nl) and log in with your student credentials. In fact, you can directly open the chapters of this manual as `.ipynb` notebooks on the UT Jupyter server by clicking the little rocket on the top of the page and selecting 'JupyterHub'. It's important to realize that if you use this option, you cannot easily access the files on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Google Colab**\n",
    "Google offers [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is a lot like Jupyter Notebooks and is (almost) fully compatible. You can upload `.ipynb` files to Google Colab and download your Google Colab notebooks as `.ipynb` files.  "
