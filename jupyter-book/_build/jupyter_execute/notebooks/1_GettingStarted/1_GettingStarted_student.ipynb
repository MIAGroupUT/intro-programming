    "## What is Python? \n",
    "Python is a programming language that allows you to write software programs. By programming in Python you can tell the computer how to do things. Just like Python, there are many other programming languages out there. You might have heard about some of them, like `C`, `C++`, `Java`. Alternatively, it might be that you have heard of (or used) `Matlab`. In general, programming languages have a lot of similarities. They all allow you to work with data, and to change that data into something else. They (almost) all have ways to visualize your data. Of course, there are also differences. Languages differ in the way that your code is *executed* on the computer, in the *syntax* that you should use when writing code, in naming conventions, etc. We use Python here because it is a widely used language that is user-friendly and allows you to get a grasp of fundamental concepts in programming.\n",

Use the file to install Anaconda. Follow the instructions and just install it as a regular software package on Windows. You can follow the detailed instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/). It's important that you *don't add Anaconda to your PATH variable*.

You can use it to - for example - navigate your computer, create and delete files, inspect which processes are happening.

    "Two things in the previous outputs are interesting to note. First, Python automatically interprets the minus sign in front of 6 and gives the correct answer. This is similar to what you would write yourself in mathematical notation. In fact, you'll see that many expressions are quite intuitive. Second, if we divide 8 by 4, we don't get 2, but we get 2.0. This has to do with the 'type' of the number. Like most programming languages, Python differentiates between integer numbers (such as 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 100000, ...) and floating point numbers (such as -45.7, 0.00001, 12.9772).

    "## Scripts\n",
    "Last week, you have used the Python interpreter to interact with Python. As you can imagine, once you want to write and run a piece of code that contains many steps, it becomes inconvenient to use the interpreter: you would have to write each line of code each time you're trying to run a oprogram. Instead, you can write Python *scripts* that can be passed to the interpreter, which will run everything line-by-line. Python scripts are files that can be *run* and are supposed to do something each time you run them. In practice, a Python file is a file whose name ends in `.py`, and can be simply a set of statements. For example, following what you did last week, the contents of a Python file can be"

    "For simple programming, Notepad will get you quite far as a script editor. However, most programmers use an 'integrated development environment' (IDE) that provides additional tools during programming to increase productivity and help you write clear and reusable code. There are many different IDEs on the market, some focusing on one programming language, one on a range of programming languages. Some are very expensive and intended for professional use, some are free. Some are complex, some are easier to use. In this course, **we will use Visual Studio Code**, commonly referred to as VS Code. VS Code is free, flexible, and widely considered to be a good entry point for new programmers. In the remainder of the course, we assume that you are using VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install VS Code, take the following steps:\n",
    "1. Go to [the Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the correct version for your computer. If you're on a Windows laptop, this is likely going to be the *User Installer* `x64` version.\n",
    "2. Run the installer to install Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "3. Open Visual Studio Code and go to 'Extensions' (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> on Windows).\n",
    "4. Install the Python extension. **Warning** There are multiple Python extensions available. You should download the most popular one by Microsoft, which has been downloaded over a 100m times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have properly installed Anaconda as described in the previous chapter, you should now be able to use Python within the VS Code IDE. You can find more information on the combination of Anaconda and VS Code on the [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/ide-tutorials/python-vsc/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good to be aware that there are other (free) IDEs that you can also use, like Spyder and PyCharm. The latter is a professional, expensive IDE that provides free licenses to students. Go to [the JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) and register as a student. Make sure to use  your University of Twente email account. Once you have received confirmation from JetBrains, download the latest version of PyCharm from [the PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

    "## Writing scripts in VS Code\n",
    "Writing code is all about keeping your files organized. With VS Code open, go to the 'Explorer' (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> on Windows). Go to `File` --> `Open Folder` and select the folder you just created and in which you stored `test.py`. If all is well, you should see the folder appear in 'Explorer', including the `test.py` file. You can double click on the `test.py` file and it will open in the VS Code editor. You will see that many colors are used to highlight individual words and characters in the code. This is called *syntax highlighting* and is a useful tool to make your code readable and easily spot errors. You can change the colors and the general look-and-feel of VS Code by picking a different theme. For this, go to `File` --> `Preferences` --> `Theme` --> `Color Theme`. Note that this is just a visualization and will not change anything to your code or what your code does. The editor in which you now see your code is basically a text editor with some nice additional functionality to make your life as a programmer easier.\n",

    "### Running scripts in VS Code\n",
    "There are two ways to run scripts from within VS Code. The first option is very similar to what you did before. From within VS Code, you can open a command line interface, similar to the one you used in the previous chapter. To do so, select `Terminal` --> `New Terminal` from the menu. A command line interface should open at the bottom of your screen. If all is well, you should already be in the same directory as the `test.py` file that you created. Verify this using the `ls` command that you learned in the previous chapter. Now, type `python` in the terminal and verify that you are using your Anaconda distribution. Next, you can, just as in the standard Windows command line interface, type `python test.py` to run your Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option basically simplifies this process for you. If you go select `Run` --> `Run Without Debugging` from the menu, VS Code will start a terminal, call the Python interpreter with your script, and output the results in a terminal window."
