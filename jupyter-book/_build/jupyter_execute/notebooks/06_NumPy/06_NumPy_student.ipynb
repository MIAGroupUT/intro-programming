    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "By now, you have programmed in the command line using the interpreter and you have written and ran scripts. Now we're going to teach you a *third* and very popular way to program in Python: using notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is a file with `.ipynb` extension that can contain code as well as text or *Markdown*. The notebook consists of *cells* and each cell can be *ran* by a Python *kernel* that is running in the background. This Python **kernel** is a lot like the interpreter you have been using interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "There are three types of cells in notebooks\n",
    "1. **Code cells**. These are cells that can be run and interpreted by Python\n",
    "2. **Markdown cells**. These are cells that contain text in the *Markdown* style. Markdown is a bit like LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run notebooks\n",
    "There are multiple ways to run Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "1. In VS Code\n",
    "2. Locally on your computer in the browser\n",
    "3. On the University of Twente server: `jupyter.utwente.nl`\n",
    "4. Google offers Google Colab, which is a lot like Jupyter Notebooks and is (almost) fully compatible\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are valid options, you might want to use option (1) to stay in VS Code, of if you'd rather work in your browser, you can use option (2). Option (3) is convenient is you don't wish to install Python/Jupyter on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting a notebook server\n",
    "Navigate to the directory in which you want to work, go to the command line and type `jupyter lab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this whole book is made out of Jupyter notebooks! You can download each chapter as an `*.ipynb` file and run it as a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command line\n",
    "When inside a Jupyter notebook, you can run things on the command line using the `!` command. For example, to list the contents of the current directory, you can run `!dir` (on Windows) or `!ls` (on Mac and Linux). This is also convenient when you're working in a notebook and you want to install a missing package. You can then run - for example - `!conda install <package_name>` without first having to go to the terminal.\n",
