    "## Modules and packages\n",
    "By now, you know how to write a function and you know that Python has a set of built-in functions. The list of built-in functions in Python is very short, yet Python is a very powerful and popular programming language. The reason for this is that Python provides *modules* and *packages* that significantly extend the basic functionality. In this chapter, you will for the first time use one of these packages, namely the NumPy package. For many practical programming problems, you'll need vectors and matrices, or *arrays*. The most common way to work with such objects in Python is using the NumPy package. NumPy is the workhorse for anything related to vectors and matrices, offers a wide range of functions, and provides the `ndarray` object that represents multidimensional matrices and is at the core of many packages in Python. This package comes preinstalled with Anaconda, so you don't have to install anything else. "

    "Let's check what kind of numbers this gives us. You'll learn all about visualization in the next Chapter, but we will give a sneak preview here. The code below asks NumPy for 10000 random numbers from the uniform and the normal distribution, respectively. Then it plots a *histogram* of these numbers. As you can see, the distributions are very different. With the normal distribution, we are much more likely to sample numbers close to 0 than further away from 0."
