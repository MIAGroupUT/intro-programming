    "## Conditional statements with `if`\n",
    "Now that you are able to write and run scripts in VS Code, it is time to do some more interesting programming. So far, your scripts have been quite predictable. They are a series of statements that are executed from top to bottom, i.e., sequential execution. One nice feature of almost all programming languages is that they allow the use of *control structures* that direct the execution of your program. One of the most commonly used control structures is the conditional statement `if`. An `if` statement looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <expr>:\n",
    "    <statement>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `<expr>` is a *boolean* expression, i.e., something that takes on the value `True` or `False`. The `<statement>` is a valid Python statement, something that will be executed if `<expr>` evaluates to `True`. The colon `:` is part of the Python syntax and should always be placed after the boolean expression. Further, note that there is some whitespace in front of the `<statement>`. This is called *indentation* and is also part of the Python syntax. Python uses four spaces as indentation. You usually don't have to care of this yourself: the interpreter and any IDE that knows that you're programming in Python will help you automatically use that indentation when necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better feeling about the behavior of the `if`-statement, take a good look at the following code examples. Note that the interpreter only prints `yes` if the `<expr>` is `True`. Otherwise, nothing happens. Also, note that `if y` gets evaluated to `True`. This is so because Python evaluates any integer value larger that is not zero as `True` (we have also seen this in the previous chapter)."
