You can ask the user for input to dynamically change what happens in a script. You've seen that with these building blocks, you can already solve some problems and write small programs. However, if you write scripts with only these building blocks, they can become quite lengthy. Most programming languages use **functions**. In Python, functions are everywhere. In fact, you have already used functions: for example, the `print()` function outputs something to the screen. We *call* this function with some input, and it writes this input to the terminal."

    "Other functions that you have used so far are `len()` and `input()`. You can think of a function as a mini-program that runs within another program or within another function. The main program calls the mini-program and sends information that the mini-program will need as it runs. When the function completes all of its actions, it may send some data back to the main program that has called it. The primary purpose of a function is to allow you to reuse the code within it whenever you need it, using different inputs if required. When you use functions, you are extending your Python vocabulary. This lets you express the solution to your problem in a clearer and more succinct way. Functions can be used many times within one script. For example, when training a neural network, you call the same functions thousands or millions of times. "
