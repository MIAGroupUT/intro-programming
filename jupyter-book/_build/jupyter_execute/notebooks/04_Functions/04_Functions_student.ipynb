You can ask the user for input to dynamically change what happens in a script. You've seen that with these building blocks, you can already solve some problems and write small programs. However, if you write scripts with only these building blocks, they can become quite lengthy. Most programming languages use **functions**. In Python, functions are everywhere. In fact, you have already used functions: for example, the `print()` function outputs something to the screen. We *call* this function with some input, and it writes this input to the terminal."

    "Other functions that you have used so far are `len()` and `input()`. You can think of a function as a mini-program that runs within another program or within another function. The main program calls the mini-program and sends information that the mini-program will need as it runs. When the function completes all of its actions, it may send some data back to the main program that has called it. The primary purpose of a function is to allow you to reuse the code within it whenever you need it, using different inputs if required. When you use functions, you are extending your Python vocabulary. This lets you express the solution to your problem in a clearer and more succinct way. Functions can be used many times within one script. For example, when training a neural network, you call the same functions thousands or millions of times. "

    "## Scope\n",
    "Each variable in Python has a `scope`. This influences the way that variables are looked up in your code. So far, we have worked with global variables. These are variables that can be accessed anywhere in the code. Setting the value of the variable in a `for` or `while` loop or in an `if`-statement changes the value everywhere. When working with functions, we have to consider the scope of a variable. This means that if a variable is defined in a function, it cannot be accessed outside of that function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the following example. We have defined a simple function `add_y` that adds some number to its input. The function works well and we can verify this with the first print statement. The number that is added is defined in a *local* variable `y`. This variable only exists within the function `add_y`. If we want to print the value at the *global* level with `print(y)` Python gives a `NameError`: it cannot find the variable `y` because it does not exist globally. "

    "We can call functions from anywhere in a script, as long as it has been defined. Moreover, in Python (and in many other languages) there is no reason why a function cannot be called from within itself. This is called a *recursive* function. Recursion is a concept that can be difficult to understand. The core idea is that you repeatedly call the same function from within itself. This means that the operations that you're applying should be very similar each time the function is called. A well-known example is the factorial $n!=n \\times n-1 \\times n-2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$. We can implement this in a recursive function as"

These are functions that are always available if you program in Python. Examples are `print()`. A complete list of built-in functions is available [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Take a look, you'll likely recognize some of them.
