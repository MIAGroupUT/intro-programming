You can ask the user for input to dynamically change what happens in a script. You've seen that with these building blocks, you can already solve some problems and write small programs. However, if you write scripts with only these building blocks, they can become quite lengthy and full of `if` statements. In Python, if we want to repeatedly do something but the output depends on some input, we are going to need **functions**. In Python, functions are everywhere. In fact, you have already used functions: for example, the `print()` function outputs something to the screen. We *call* this function with some input, and it writes it to the screen."

    "Other functions that you have used so far are `len()` and `input()`. You can think of a function as a mini-program that runs within another program or within another function. The main program calls the mini-program and sends information that the mini-program will need as it runs. When the function completes all of its actions, it may send some data back to the main program that has called it. The primary purpose of a function is to allow you to reuse the code within it whenever you need it, using different inputs if required.

    "## Built-in functions\n",
    "You don't have to define each function yourself: Python has a number of built-in functions that are available in any Python distribution. Useful functions include the `len`, `print` and `input` functions that you have already used. In addition to the functions that you can write yourself, Python has a number of *built-in* functions. These are functions that are always available if you program in Python. Examples are `print()`. A complete list of built-in functions is available [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Take a look, you'll likely recognize some of them. We have previously used the `round()` and `range()` functions, and it's clear what - for example - the `abs()` does. Likewise, you have used the `type()` function to find out what the type of a variable is."

    "So far, you have used `input` to ask the user for inputs. Another option to make your scripts depend on user input is to provide *arguments* to the script. The easiest way to do this is using the `sys` package. Each time a Python script is called, it is called with a list of arguments. The first item in the list is always the name of the script, the second item is the first argument, etc. This means that we can *call* a script with some arguments that define its output. In a very simple case, let's say that we have a script called `add.py` and its contents are \n",
