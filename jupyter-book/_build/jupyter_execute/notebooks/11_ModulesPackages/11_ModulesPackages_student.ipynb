    "## Modules\n",
    "A Python module is nothing more than a `*.py` file that you import and that defines variables and classes. This can be very convenient. For example, if you have written some functions or objects that you use in many different programming projects, you can put those functions in a module that you can easily reuse. Consider the contents of the following file, which we shall call `mod.py`. The module contains two variables, a function and a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello world.\"\n",
    "a = [100, 200, 300]\n",
    "\n",
    "def foo(arg):\n",
    "    print('arg = {}'.format(arg))\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Foo:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that you want to use the function `foo()` in many different projects. If we have a different file, let's say, `project.py`, and we want to use the function `foo()` in `project.py`, we simply to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import mod\n",
    "\n",
    "mod.foo(\"Test module\")\n",

    "The expected behavior is that now the function `foo()` will be called to output \"Test module\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to import a module, it is very important that it can be found by Python. If you put the file in the same directory from which the script was called, you should be good. Alternatively you can put the module file in any other directory as long as it's on your `PYTHONPATH`. This is an *environment variable* that points to the location of Python libraries. Modules/packages that you install in Anaconda are automatically on your Python path."

    "## Importing modules\n",
    "The easiest way to use a module is by importing it via `import <modulename>` as we just did. It's important to realize that - after importing - we cannot call all the functions in `mod.py` as if they are in `project.py`: we always need to prepend the module name and add a dot. For example, in the case above, calling `foo(\"Test module\")` will not work because Python does not understand what you mean with `foo()`. Instead, we have to explicitly use `mod.foo(\"Test module\")` so that Python will actually use the `foo()` function from the `mod` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we *can* import parts of the module directly, but that means that any other function, variable or class with the same name that we would have in our current `*.py` file get overwritten. To achieve this, we would use `from mod import foo` instead of `import mod`. Now, we can use `foo(\"Test module\")` instead of `mod.foo(\"Test module\")`. If you're absolutely confident that you want to import everything from a module and don't want to bother with prepending module names, you can also use `from mod import *`. The `*` commonly means 'everything' in programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing that you can do, is import a function, variable or class directly, but give it a different name for greater ease. In this case, you could use `from mod import foo as bar` and in the `project.py` script call `bar(\"Test module\")`. You can use any term, here `bar` is just an *alias*. Similarly, you can import entire modules under alternate names: `import mod as modest`."

    "## Packages\n",
    "A package in Python is a collection of several modules that can be accessed via *dot-notation*. For example, you have used the Matplotlib *package*, which has a Pyplot *module* `matplotlib.pyplot`. Packages can either be imported in full, or separate modules can be imported. Importing a package works similarly as importing a module, and in pratice you will likely not notice the difference."

    "## How to install modules or packages\n",
    "There are multiple ways to *manage* or organize your packages in Python. Typically you'll use `pip`, the standard Python package manager, or Anaconda. Anaconda has a couple of advantages over `pip` in the way that it manages packages, which is why we advice you to use it. Anaconda comes with >100 pre-installed packages that might come in handy, so you don't have to install every package from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many packages, you can use\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install <package_name>```\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "Very few - if any - packages in Python are completely independent from other packages. You will see that packages or modules typically import functionality from other packages and modules. If package A is dependent on package B to work, we call package B a *dependency* of A. Dependencies often take on the form of a tree or graph and one package can be directly and indirectly dependent on many packages. Things can get complicated when packages have different *versions*. As most code in Python is under constant development, new versions of packages get released all the time. This also holds for Python itself, whose most current version (in January 2024) is v3.12.1. Things can get real complicated real quickly. For example, the below graph visualizes the dependencies of the `six` package. You can see that versions of some packages should be higher than or equal to a particular version (`>=`), while others should *not* be of a particular version (`!=`) for this package to be used. \n",

    "## Anaconda environments\n",
    "You can probably imagine that if you want to install ten different packages to run your code with, there can be conflicts between dependencies. For example, for package A some dependency should have at least a particular version, while for package B that version is not supported. One of the reasons to use Anaconda as your package manager is that it automatically tries to resolve these conflicts. Anaconda performs *dependency* management and will look for versions that are compatible with packages that you have already installed. If it is impossible to solve this puzzle, it will also tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the more packages you install, the higher the chance becomes that there will be some version conflicts that cannot be resolved. That's why it's always smart to work with *environments*. An environment in Anaconda is a directory that contains a specific set of packages that you have installed. You could for example make an Anaconda environment for this course, and a different environment for some other course where you use other packages and dependencies. The [Anaconda website](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) contains excellent documentation on how to properly set up environments. We'll here show you the basics."

    "\n",
    "Note that a new 'clean' environment does not contain all the packages that your default - `base` - Anaconda environment contains.

Alternatively, you can add particular packages (and their versions) that you want to install immediately\n",

This is a bit more advanced and is explained in more detail [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually). One great feature of Anaconda is that you can also make this file automatically based on your currently used packages.
