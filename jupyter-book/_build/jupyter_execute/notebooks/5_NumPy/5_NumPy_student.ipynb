    "##  Vectors and matrices\n",
    "For many practical programming problems, you'll need vectors and matrices, or *arrays*. The most common way to work with such objects in Python is using the NumPy package. NumPy is the workhorse for anything related to vectors and matrices, offers a wide range of functions, and provides the `ndarray` object that represents multidimensional matrices and is at the core of many packages in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing NumPy\n",
    "NumPy is a Python package that needs to be imported in order for you to use it. To import NumPy, just write ```import numpy as np``` at the top of your script. Note that here we are importing the NumPy library with an alias `np`, which is a convention. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "Numpy uses objects called *arrays* to store 1D, 2D, 3D, nD data. It's important to realize that it doesn't matter if you have a 1D vector, a 2D matrix, or a 3D or 4D tensor: it's all stored as an array. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Numpy matrices\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "In the NumPy documentation you might also find something about *matrices*. These are no longer recommended to use: the NumPy developers advice that you use *arrays* instead, also when working in 2D.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "![Numpy arrays](https://i0.wp.com/indianaiproduction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NumPy-array.png?w=1284&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first chapter, you have learned about slicing and indexing of lists and tuples. Slicing in a NumPy array is very similar to slicing in a list. In general, you'll see that NumPy arrays are quite similar to lists. We can slice and index NumPy arrays, change individual items and append values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1D arrays\n",
    "Vectors or 1-dimensional (1D) arrays are easily defined by listing the entries separated by commas or spaces, e.g., ```v = [11, 12, 13]```. The number of entries of a vector is known as the *length* of the vector. Each array also has a shape, which in the case of a vector, has only one value (which is the same as the length). Each value in an array is called an *element*. You can always find out the shape of your vector by asking for its `shape` attribute."
