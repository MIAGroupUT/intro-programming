So far, your scripts have been quite predictable. They are a series of statements that are executed from top to bottom, i.e., sequential execution. One nice feature of almost all programming languages is that they allow the use of *control structures* that direct the execution of your program. One of the most commonly used control structures is the conditional statement `if`.

The `<statement>` is a valid Python statement, something that will be executed if `<expr>` evaluates to `True`. The colon `:` is part of the Python syntax and should always be placed after the boolean expression. Further, note that there is some whitespace in front of the `<statement>`. This is called *indentation* and is also part of the Python syntax. Python uses four spaces as indentation.
