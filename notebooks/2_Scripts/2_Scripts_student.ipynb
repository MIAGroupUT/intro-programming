Instead, you can write Python *scripts* that can be passed to the interpreter, which will run everything line-by-line. Python scripts are files that can be *run* and are supposed to do something each time you run them.

However, most programmers use an 'integrated development environment' (IDE) that provides additional tools during programming to increase productivity and help you write clear and reusable code. There are many different IDEs on the market, some focusing on one programming language, one on a range of programming languages. Some are very expensive and intended for professional use, some are free. Some are complex, some are easier to use. In this course, **we will use Visual Studio Code**, commonly referred to as VS Code. VS Code is free, flexible, and widely considered to be a good entry point for new programmers. In the remainder of the course, we assume that you are using VS Code.\n", "\n", "To install VS Code, take the following steps:\n", "1.

You can double click on the `test.py` file and it will open in the VS Code editor. You will see that many colors are used to highlight individual words and characters in the code. This is called *syntax highlighting* and is a useful tool to make your code readable and easily spot errors. You can change the colors and the general look-and-feel of VS Code by picking a different theme. For this, go to `File` --> `Preferences` --> `Theme` --> `Color Theme`.

So far, your scripts have been quite predictable. They are a series of statements that are executed from top to bottom, i.e., sequential execution. One nice feature of almost all programming languages is that they allow the use of *control structures* that direct the execution of your program. One of the most commonly used control structures is the conditional statement `if`. An `if` statement looks like this:\n", "\n", "```python\n", "if <expr>:\n", "    <statement>\n", "```\n", "\n", "Here, `<expr>` is a *boolean* expression, i.e., something that takes on the value `True` or `False`. The `<statement>` is a valid Python statement, something that will be executed if `<expr>` evaluates to `True`. The colon `:` is part of the Python syntax and should always be placed after the boolean expression. Further, note that there is some whitespace in front of the `<statement>`. This is called *indentation* and is also part of the Python syntax. Python always uses four spaces as indentation. You usually don't have to care of this yourself: the interpreter and any IDE that knows that you're programming in Python will help you automatically use that indentation when necessary. \n", "\n", "To get a better feeling about the behavior of the `if`-statement, take a good look at the following code. Note that the interpreter only prints `yes` if the `<expr>` is `True`. Otherwise, nothing happens. Also, note that `if y` gets evaluated to `True`. This is so because the value of `y` is larger than zero. The `or` in `x or y` does exactly what you expect it to do: it will evaluate to `True` if either of the two expressions that it connects is `True`. In contrast, for the `x and y` statement to be `True`, both `x` and `y` should evaluate to `True`, which is here not the case.\n", "\n", "```python\n", ">>> x = 0\n", ">>> y = 5\n", "\n", ">>> if x < y:                            # True\n", "...     print('yes')\n", "...\n", "yes\n", ">>> if y < x:                            # False\n", "...     print('yes')\n", "...\n", "\n", ">>> if x:                                # False\n", "...     print('yes')\n", "...\n", ">>> if y:                                # True\n", "...     print('yes')\n", "...\n", "yes\n", "\n", ">>> if x or y:                           # True\n", "...     print('yes')\n", "...\n", "yes\n", ">>> if x and y:                          # False\n", "...     print('yes')\n", "...\n", "```\n", "\n", ":::{admonition} Exercise 2.3\n", ":class: tip\n", "A bank will offer a customer a loan if they are 21 or over and have an annual income of at least \u20ac21000.
