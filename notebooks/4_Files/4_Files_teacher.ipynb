One thing to consider when using pathnames in your code, is that the directory structure of each computer is different. If you *hard code* your pathnames (i.e., you write explicit pathnames in your code), your code might not be easy to run on some other computer. It is good practice to let the user define some base path variable somewhere, and use the `os` package to combine that path into new paths.
