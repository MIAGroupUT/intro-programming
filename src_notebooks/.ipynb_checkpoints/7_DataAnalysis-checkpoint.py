# * process this data
# * write data to different file formats
# * apply simple filters to images

# In this chapter, we're going to be working with a few commonly used packages for data. 
#
# ## Scipy
# According to it's website, the [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) package does the following:
#
# > SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.
#
# You'll see that with NumPy and SciPy, you are able to replicate a lot of the functionality that is present in Matlab. Scipy even offers [utilities to load and save Matlab files](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/io.matlab.html). 
#
# ## Image analysis
# The [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) package offers a lot of functionality in image analysis.

# ## Advanced visualization
# You have previously worked with Matplotlib to generate plots. Matplotlib is by far the most widely used visualization package in Python, but there are other - more specialized - packages available if you want to make other figures. Here, we'll touch upon two well-developed packages: [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/). As often in this course, we aim to introduce some common functionality and a quick introduction these packages, but encourage you to take a close look at their documentation to find out the broad range of functionality that they offer.
#
# ### Seaborn
# Seaborn is a data package that is very useful for visualization of data. It is built on top of Matplotlib and uses many of the same objects.
